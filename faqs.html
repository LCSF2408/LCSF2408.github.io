        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Vacuum Cleaners</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>What type of vacuum cleaner is best for my home?</li>
            <p>The best vacuum cleaner depends on your needs. For carpets, consider an upright vacuum. For hardwood or tile floors, a canister vacuum works well. For small spaces, stick vacuums or robotic vacuums are ideal.</p>

            <li>How often should I replace the vacuum cleanerâ€™s filter?</li>
            <p>Most filters need replacement every 3-6 months, but it depends on usage and the type of filter. Check your user manual for specific recommendations.</p>

            <li>What is the difference between a bagged and a bagless vacuum cleaner?</li>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Bagged Vacuums: </span>Capture dirt in a disposable bag. They are hygienic and great for allergy sufferers.</li>
                <li><span>Bagless Vacuums: </span>Use a dust container that you empty and clean. They are cost-effective and eco-friendly.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Can vacuum cleaners handle pet hair effectively?</li>
            <p>Yes, many vacuums are designed for pet owners, featuring strong suction, tangle-free brushes, and HEPA filters to capture allergens. Look for models labeled "pet-friendly."</p>

            <li>What does a HEPA filter do?</li>
            <p>HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters trap 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, including dust, pollen, and pet dander, making them ideal for allergy sufferers.</p>

            <li>How do I maintain my vacuum cleaner?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Empty the dustbin or replace the bag regularly.</li>
                <li>Clean or replace filters as needed.</li>
                <li>Check and clean the brush roll for hair and debris</li>
                <li>Inspect hoses and attachments for blockages.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>How often should I vacuum my home?</li>
            <p>For high-traffic areas, vacuum at least 2-3 times a week. For less-used areas, once a week is usually sufficient.</p>

            <li>Are robotic vacuums as effective as traditional vacuums?</li>
            <p>Robotic vacuums are excellent for daily maintenance and small messes, but traditional vacuums are more powerful for deep cleaning.</p>

            <li>Can vacuum cleaners clean liquid spills?</li>
            <p>Standard vacuums are not designed for liquids and can be damaged. Use a wet/dry vacuum for handling spills.</p>

            <li>Why does my vacuum cleaner lose suction?</li>
            <p>Loss of suction can occur due to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A full dustbin or bag.</li>
                <li>Clogged filters or hoses.</li>
                <li>Blocked brush rolls.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Can I use a vacuum cleaner on delicate surfaces like curtains?</li>
            <p>Yes, many vacuums have adjustable suction levels and specialized attachments for delicate surfaces like curtains and upholstery.</p>
